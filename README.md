About Me
I am a web developer in training, passionate about learning new technologies and improving my skills. I am currently looking for my first job opportunity in the world of web development, where I can apply what I've learned and continue growing professionally.

🌱 Currently I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
🤝 Looking to collaborate on projects and internships to enhance my skills.
💼 Open to junior web development job opportunities.

💻 Developing Skills
HTML5: Semantic markup, web page structure.
CSS3: Responsive design, Flexbox, Grid.
JavaScript: Basic DOM manipulation, events, and programming logic.
Git & GitHub: Version control and project collaboration.

🚀 Projects
Project 1: Weather App.
Weather App is a web application that provides current weather information and short-term forecasts for any location in the world. Use the OpenWeatherMap API to get accurate and up-to-date data.

Project 2: Letter.
This is a small project developed by me to demonstrate my skills within HTML, CSS and JS. This is a card that contains a message, it also has two buttons, open and close. This so that when you press the open button the message comes out and when you close the message is put in and the letter is closed.
